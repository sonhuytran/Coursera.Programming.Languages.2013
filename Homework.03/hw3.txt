Create your solutions file by including a copy of the code in hw3provided.sml. A simple way to do this is just to start with hw3provided.sml and add your code. Do not use the use construct in your solution file as our grading scripts cannot handle this: they need all the solution code to be in one file (with the testing code in another file; the testing code can use use).

Several problems require you to use certain library functions. Our grading scripts will check that you do so. Creating your own function of the same name is not a correct approach. (As in Homework 2, you should also use pattern matching, rather than the # character or functions like hd and tl.)
