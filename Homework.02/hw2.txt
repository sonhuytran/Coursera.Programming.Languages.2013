Create your solutions file by including a copy of the code in hw2provided.sml. A simple way to do this is just to start with hw2provided.sml and add your code. Do not use the use construct in your solution file as our grading scripts cannot handle this: they need all the solution code to be in one file (with the testing code in another file; the testing code can use use).

Make sure your solution file does not contain the # character anywhere in it, not even in comments. Our grading scripts will search for this character to check that you are not using the language constructs #2 or #foo, which you should not use on this assignment. A simple search for the # character is imperfect, but much simpler than any alternatives, so we are leaving it up to you not to include this character to avoid losing points.
